### Arrays:
An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data and allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. It can hold any type of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays consist of an ordered collection or list containing zero or more data types, and use numbered indices starting from 0 to access specific items.

- Array literal
    -  is a way of declaring an array in JavaScript by using the square brackets [] and putting the elements inside them, separated by commas.

    Example: const arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
- Array declaration using Array()
    Example:
    const arr = new Array(1,2,3,4,5)

    - The new keyword in JavaScript is used to create an instance of an object that is defined by a constructor function. It allocates memory for the object and sets the prototype of the object to the prototype property of the constructor function.
