## Objects: 

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

Objects are important data structures in JavaScript. This is partly because arrays are objects in JavaScript, and you'll use them all the time. Objects are super important for grouping data and functionalities, so you can do a lot with an object in JavaScript.

 **_NOTE:_**
 ___
  The main difference in using the arrays and objects are in their order arrays are used for more ordered data and objects are used for data that order doesn't matter and that is because the we can'nt get the data in arrays without knowing their _index_ which is not the same for objects because the keys are already know to us.

Syntax:
    
    var objectName = {
        key:value,
        key:value,
    }

## Object Methods:

Object methods in JavaScript are functions that are stored as properties of an object. These methods can be called on the object to perform specific actions or calculations.
