Dodge is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It was founded as the Dodge Brothers Company by Horace and John Dodge in 1900. Initially, they supplied parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers before founding the Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company in 1913, manufacturing complete vehicles.

Here are some key points about Dodge:

Recent Developments: In recent years, Dodge has focused on enhancing its performance-oriented image, often emphasizing high-powered engines and aggressive styling. They have introduced variants with high-horsepower engines, such as the Hellcat and Demon editions, to cater to the performance car market.
