The history of Dodge dates back to the early 20th century when brothers John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge established the Dodge Brothers Company in 1900. Initially, they manufactured engine and chassis components for various Detroit-based automobile firms. However, their big break came when they began supplying components for Henry Ford's early automobile ventures.

In 1914, the Dodge Brothers Company introduced its first complete car, the Dodge Model 30. This vehicle was well-received for its durability and high-quality construction. The company quickly gained a reputation for producing reliable and robust vehicles, which contributed to its rapid growth in the automotive industry.

In the years that followed, Dodge continued to innovate and expand its product line, catering to different market segments. During the 1920s, Dodge became one of the leading automobile manufacturers in the United States, known for its sturdy vehicles and advanced engineering.

In 1928, Dodge was acquired by the Chrysler Corporation, which enabled it to access greater resources and technology for further development. Throughout the 20th century, Dodge continued to release a range of popular models, including trucks and passenger cars, solidifying its position as a prominent American automotive brand.

Dodge gained particular recognition for its muscle cars and high-performance vehicles, such as the Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger, which were introduced in the 1960s and have since become iconic symbols of American automotive culture.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Dodge expanded its product offerings to include SUVs and minivans, further diversifying its portfolio. The Dodge Caravan, introduced in 1984, played a significant role in popularizing the concept of the modern minivan in the United States.

Over the years, Dodge has undergone several changes in ownership and corporate restructuring, ultimately becoming a part of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) group. As of my last knowledge update in 2021, Dodge remained an essential division of the FCA group, which later merged with Groupe PSA to form Stellantis, one of the world's largest automotive groups. Throughout its history, Dodge has maintained a focus on producing powerful, durable, and innovative vehicles that appeal to a broad range of consumers.</p>
